In 2014, the most permits were sold in March and decreased July and November. In 2015, March was the month in which the second most number of permits were sold. Permits sold generally decreased in the summer months of 2015. In 2016, the most number of permits were sold in March and permits sold increased between May and July. Finally in 2017, the number of permits sold decreased after reaching a high point in March. Therefore, March is most commonly the month where the most permits were sold. This is significant because more guns in March would therefore lead to more gun violence incidents in the summer months. Furthermore, Kentucky was most often the state that granted the most number of permits over much larger states. This is especially significant given that the population of Kentucky is about 4 million people while the population of California is about 40 million ", a("(source)", href="https://www.census.gov/search-results.html?searchType=web&cssp=SERP&q=state%20population"), "."),
