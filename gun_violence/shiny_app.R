            "Just as the effects of gun violence are wide-reaching, impacting individuals as well as 
            community sentiment, there is no single cause of gun violence in the United States. Therefore, 
            I am interested in analyzing how gun violence correlates to economic injustice and the impact of 
            community-based programs. Does data show that communities with gun violence programs actually experience 
            a decrease in gun violence? By evaluating the statistically significant rates of gun violence compared to 
            the population, I located the cities on which to focus my analysis.
            The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) 
            provides data on how many background checks were conducted in the United States. This data is converted 
            from PDF to CSV by Buzzfeed News and is significant as firearm background checks often have a close correlation 
            to gun sales and therefore are a good indication of a state’s gun sales. Through my data analysis, I plan to 
            explore whether there is a connection between increased gun sales and more gun violence. 
            To determine public policies related to guns, I made use of a dataset that compiles information about different 
            state’s public policies. Students and scholars through Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy 
            and Social Research worked to organize and make policy data publicly available. 
            Through The Trace, a resource that publishes information related to gun violence, I acquired a data source that 
            provides information on the state, date, number killed, number injured, and age group for over 230,000 incidents 
            involving gun violence. This gun violence datasource is from an organization called Gun Violence Archive which 
            finds data by combing through local and state police and other government sources that report gun violence and crime. 
            To compare the number of background checks conducted, the number of public policies compared to population size, and 
            gun violence incidents, I located a data source that provides population information for more than 28,000 United States 
            cities and towns. This data was compiled through the use of data from the United States Census Bureau and the United 
            States Geological Survey.
            
            
            In the drop down graphics tab, the graphs show the top ten states that granted the most gun permits as well as the total 
            number of gun permits granted per month. The slider graphics tab shows the number of gun permits granted per month then graphs
            the top ten states that granted the most permits for that month where the most number of permits were granted. For the 2013 tab,
            I also created a gt table which shows the number of incidents per state in the month that granted the most number of permits in 
            2013. Next, the regression tab shows a linear regression model of the number of permits granted per month in relation to the number
            of gun violence incidents. The x axis of my first graph is a log of the x axis of my second graph in order to see where the data is 
            most concentrated. Users may also hover over each point to see more information about the point. The regression coefficient plot
            is a visual representation of my linear regression.
