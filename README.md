# More Permits More Problems? Tracing Factors Correlated to Gun Violence

[Shiny App](https://emilyaxelsen.shinyapps.io/gun_violence/)

For my final project, I was intrigued by the connection between gun violence and the number of permits granted which correlates to the number of firearms sold. By analyzing the number of permits granted each month between 2013 and 2017, I noticed a trend where the most permits sold was often in March and the state that often sold the most permits was Kentucky. Through my data analysis, I noticed that the number of permits sold has a positive correlation to the number of gun violence incidents. However, states that required gun registration had similar levels of gun violence incidents compared to states that did not require gun registration.
